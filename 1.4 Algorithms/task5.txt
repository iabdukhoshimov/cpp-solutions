Merge Sort:

Merge Sort has a space complexity of O(n) in the worst case.
The additional space is required for creating temporary arrays during the merging phase of the algorithm.
The size of the temporary arrays is proportional to the size of the input array.
However, Merge Sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm, as it requires additional space for merging the subarrays.
Quick Sort:

Quick Sort has an average case space complexity of O(log n) and a worst case space complexity of O(n).
Quick Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that operates by partitioning the input array and sorting the partitions recursively.
The space complexity arises due to the recursive function calls in the sorting process.
In the average case, the recursion depth is logarithmic to the size of the input array, leading to a space complexity of O(log n).
However, in the worst case, when the chosen
